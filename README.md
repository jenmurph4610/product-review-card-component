## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had to look up :focus as a refresher on what exactly it does.  I don't think I have really used it to this point in any of my practicing, paying attention to :hover only.  I think the article I used for my refresher helped serve as a reminder to think beyond the mouse pointer as :focus comes into play when tabbling through a page, or clicking your cursor into a field.

### Continued development

I am going to continue practicing, with focus on display types that I am still looking up frequently to remember the differences and which to use for my needs.  I attempted to use display: inline in this project in a couple of areas where I wanted items to be side by side instead of stacked (in <main> within the desktop layout and in the #price-sections of both).  These did not work as I expected and I ended up using display:flex for them instead.  This worked and I accomplished what I needed, however I do need to study and practice more to solidify my understanding of this topic.
